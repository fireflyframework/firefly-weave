# Changelog

## 0.1.0a2

- Add a user-local CLI installer with verified release assets, hash-locked client
  dependencies, isolated environments, safe upgrades, and managed uninstall.
- Add ASCII branding, grouped plain-language help, nested command help, and
  `weave --version`, while preserving machine-readable command output.
- Reorganize onboarding around local authoring, an existing API, and running the
  platform; explain authentication, scope, expected results, and recovery steps.
- Add illustrated CLI, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud deployment guides.
- Include installer assets, deployment templates, and the complete public
  documentation in the source distribution; verify installation during checks.

No database migrations or workflow-language changes are introduced in this release.

## 0.1.0a1

- Typed workflow schemas, expressions, bounded compilation and canonical artifacts.
- Draft/publication/activation lifecycle, durable PostgreSQL runtime, workers,
  waits, signals, schedules, simulation, history/replay and incident controls.
- Native PyFly API, Python SDK/CLI, provider-neutral identity boundaries and local grants.
- HTTP/webhooks, PostgreSQL, Kafka, integration outbox, connector authoring and provider inbox.
- Teams personal-bot text, WhatsApp Cloud API text/template/status scope, and
  Telegram webhook text integration with local fixture/backend verification.
- OpenAPI 3.1 connector generation with bounded HTTP profiles and offline diagnostics.
- Operational capacity policies, compatibility checks, retention controls and optional telemetry.
- Container packaging, remote worker deployment, and backup/restore guides.
- Editable SVG diagrams and Apache 2.0 source attribution.

See [current capabilities](docs/capabilities.md) for integration scope and
verification boundaries. Messaging connectors have local protocol verification;
live provider account provisioning and message delivery require separate validation.
